# BankAccount Unit Test Project

## 1. Project Title & Goal
This project is created to test the BankAccount class using Python Pytest.

## 2. Setup Instructions
First install pytest:
pip install pytest

To run the tests:
pytest

## 3. The Logic (How I thought)
I selected Pytest because it is easy to use and suitable for beginners.
I wrote separate test functions to check deposit, withdraw, and initial balance.
The main difficulty I faced was checking error conditions, which I handled using pytest.raises().

## 4. Output Screenshots
Below screenshot shows that all test cases are passed successfully.

## 5. Future Improvements
If I get more time, I will add more test cases for edge conditions and improve validations.
